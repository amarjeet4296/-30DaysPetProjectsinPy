'''Problem Description

You are given two integer matrices A and B having same size(Both having same number of rows (N) and columns (M)). You have to subtract matrix A from B and return the resultant matrix. (i.e. return the matrix A - B).

If X and Y are two matrices of the same order (same dimensions). Then X - Y is a matrix of the same order as X and Y and its elements are obtained by subtracting the elements of Y from the corresponding elements of X. Thus if Z = [z[i][j]] = X - Y, then [z[i][j]] = [x[i][j]] â€“ [y[i][j]].



Problem Constraints

1 <= N, M <= 103

-109 <= A[i][j], B[i][j] <= 109



Input Format

First argument is a 2D integer matrix A.

Second argument is a 2D integer matrix B.



Output Format

Return a 2D matrix denoting A - B.'''
