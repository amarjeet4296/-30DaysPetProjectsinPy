'''Problem Description

You are given an integer T denoting the number of test cases. For each test case, you are given an integer array A.

You have to put the odd and even elements of array A in 2 separate arrays and print the new arrays.

NOTE: Array elements should have the same relative order as in A.'''

T = int(input())
for i in range(T):
    n = int(input())
    A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    odd = []
    even = []
    for j in A:
        if j%2 == 0:
            even.append(j)
        else:
            odd.append(j)
    for o in range(len(odd)):
        print(odd[o], end = " ")
    print()
    for e in range(len(even)):
        print(even[e], end = " ")
