## Time Complexity

Performance Analysis of algorithm considers the resources used by the system such as space occupied by the algorithm and the time required to execute the algorithm.

Performance Analysis of Algorithm is an important part of a computational theory, which provides theoretical estimates for the resources needed by any algorithm.
