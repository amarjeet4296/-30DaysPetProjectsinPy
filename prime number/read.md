## Prime Number
In prime number there are two factors "one" and "the number itself".
In the *Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic* - "Every integer greate than one, either is a prime number or can be represented as a product of prime numbers, uniquely"\n

e.g - 15 = 3 x 5, where 15 ia not prime but this can be represented with 3 & 5 which is prime.
