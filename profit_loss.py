Problem Constraints

1 <= C, S <= 109

C â‰  S



Input Format

First line of the input contains a single integer C.

Second line of the input contains a single integer S.



Output Format

Print two integers in separate lines.

First integer denotes whether there is a profit or loss. If there is a profit, print 1, else print -1.

Second integer is a non-negative integer denoting the absolute value of total profit or loss.'''

C, S = map(int, input().split())
if C<S:
    print("Profit: ", str(1))
else:
    print("Loss: ", str(-1))
